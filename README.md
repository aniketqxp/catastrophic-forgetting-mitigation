# catastrophic-forgetting-mitigation
Addresses catastrophic forgetting in neural networks for adaptable AI. This project compares Regularization, Replay, &amp; Architectural methods on Split-MNIST (Task/Class-Incremental Learning). Measures performance via accuracy, forgetting rate, and efficiency to reveal trade-offs and advance continual learning strategies.
